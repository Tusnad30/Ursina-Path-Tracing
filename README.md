# Ursina-Path-Tracing

Run main.py to start.

When there are FPS issues, open frag.glsl in the shaders folder and modify the variables at the top. Per vertex path tracing can be enabled inside of main.py at the top.


Feel free to create your own maps:

map_a_y#.tiff --> black = air

map_e_y#.tiff --> not black = emmisive (light)
